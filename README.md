# Flexible Imputation of Missing Data, Second Edition {-}

This repository contains the R Markdown source for the online 
version of *Flexible Imputation of Missing Data, Second Edition*
(https://stefvanbuuren.name/fimd/). 

Probably the most useful file is `R\fimd.R`, which contains the 
sources used to perform the analyses in the book.
