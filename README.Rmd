## Flexible Imputation of Missing Data, Second Edition {-}

This repository contains the R Markdown source for the online 
version of *Flexible Imputation of Missing Data, Second Edition*
(https://stefvanbuuren.name/fimd/). 

This repository tracks changes made to the book.

Probably the most useful file is `R\fimd.R`, which contains the 
sources used to perform the analyses in the book.

In case you want to alert me on any errors, inconsistencies 
or possible improvements, please open an issue or submit a pull
request.
